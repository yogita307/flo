				<h1 class="sub-title">Conception Tips</h1>  <br>
				<p>You're most fertile at the time of ovulation (when an egg is released from your ovaries), which usually occurs 12 to 14 days before your next period starts.
				 This is the time of the month when you're most likely to get pregnant.Keep in mind that baby making is a numbers game.
				 Even if you do everything ‘right’ you still only have a 25-30 percent chance of conceiving in any given cycle.

					<ul>
                    1.Water<br>
This helps the kidneys to flush out waste products from the body and increases fertile quality cervical fluid.<br>
<br>
                    2. Avoid alcohol and smoking <br>
					It is a good idea to avoid or strictly limit alcohol intake as this reduces fertility. 
					Smoking decreases sperm count and increases sperm abnormalities in men<br>
<br>
                    3.Exercise <br>
					A fit, healthy body is also more likely to cope better with child birth.
					Find a balance though because excessive amounts of exercise can lead to fertility problems<br>
<br>
                    4. Sex <br>
                    Have sex often, at least 3 times a week, the more often you try, the more chances you get at becoming pregnant.<br>
<br>
					5. Supplement<br>
					Taking a supplement specially formulated for before conception will provide you with 400mcg folic acid and 
					other nutrients such as l-arginine vitamin D and vitamin B12 which help support the nutritional requirements of women trying to conceive.<br>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="tab-contents " id="Dietary advice">
					<ul>
                    Leafy greens such as broccoli, fortified breakfast cereals, citrus fruits and pulses provide folic acid which is important for the baby’s neural tube development.<br>
                    <br>
                    Fortified breakfast cereals, lentils, soy beans, dried fruit and leafy greens such as spinach are great sources of iron.<br>
                    <br>
                    Eating mono-unsaturated fat – found in peanuts, almonds and cashews may support conception too.<br>
                    <br>
                    Fibre rich beans and whole grains keep the bowels healthy, helping to flush away the bodies waste, thereby increasing the chances of getting pregnant.<br>
                    <br>
                    Fish, wholegrain breads, asparagus, spinach and watercress will provide zinc to help keep the immune system strong, which is essential when trying to get pregnant.
					Zinc can also help the production of healthy eggs, as well as healthy sperm.<br>

					<ul>1. You can’t get pregnant when you are menstruating<br>
                    <br>
                        2. Having sex every day will increase our chances of conceiving<br>
                        <br>
                        3. You can only conceive from sex on the day that you ovulate<br>
                        <br>
                        4. Lying down with legs raised after sex will increase chances of getting pregnant<br>
                        <br>
                        5. Eating oysters will boost my fertility<br>
                        <br>
                        6. You can get everything you need from diet and don’t need to take supplements <br>
                        <br>
                        7. Having an orgasm helps suck up the sperm.<br>
						<br>
						8.To conceive a boy, have sex right before ovulation. Want a girl? Do it a few days before.

				<h1 class="sub-title">Using Ovulation Calculator</h1> <br>
				<p>Ovulation calculators, charts, and calendars are tools that attempt to predict when you might ovulate.
				   These tools are based on the typical length of your menstrual cycle and the expected window for ovulation to help time sex for pregnancy. 
				<div class="tab-titles">
					<p class="tab-links active-link" onclick="opentab('working')">Working</p>

				</div>
				<div class="tab-contents active-tab" id="Working">
					<ul>
                    Most simple ovulation predictor tools just ask for the date of the first day of your last period and the average length of your menstrual cycles.
					If you don’t know your regular cycle length, most calendars will suggest that you use 28 days. This is considered the average but research shows there is actually significant variation from woman to woman (and even cycle to cycle for some women). 
					A "normal" cycle can range from 21 to 35 days.<br>
					<br>
					More precise ovulation calendars will factor in how long your personal luteal phase is in addition to your average cycle length.
					To correct for any possible miscalculation, add a few days on at the end of your projected fertility window.<br>
					<br>
					While online ovulation calculators are available, you can also do the same math yourself to determine your most fertile days rather than relying on an online prediction tool.<br>
					<br>
					In fact, women (and doctors) have been doing these calculations on paper for decades. 
					Just follow the example above but plug in your personal last period start date, cycle length, and luteal phase length (if unknown, use 14 days). 
                    For more help on this, see ovulation prediction charting, and to confirm you are doing it correctly for your particular medical situation, consult with your doctor.<br>
					<br>
					If you’re utilizing an ovulation chart to time when to use an ovulation predictor kit (OPK), start using testing a couple of days before you expect to ovulate to be sure that you catch the LH surge the precedes ovulation.
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="tab-contents " id="Ovulation prediction charting">
					<ul>
					Make your own ovulation charting by following these simple steps:<br>
					<br>
					1.Consider:
 the information in the chart as a best-guess estimate. If you want a more accurate prediction of ovulation day, try basal body temperature charting.
Know the average number of days in your cycle. This is the number of days from when one period starts and the next begins. The best way to estimate this is by charting your periods over several months.<br>
<br>
Remember: that you are most fertile one to two days before you ovulate. Your odds of pregnancy during your fertile period increase the closer you are to these optimal few days but pregnancy can still occur in the wider fertility window.<br>
<br>
Understand: how to count cycle days. The day you get your period is Cycle Day 1; 15 days later is Cycle Day 15, and so on. The last day of your cycle is the day before you get your next period and is indicative of the length of your cycle.<br>
<br>
Track: your fertility window by plotting your cycle on a calendar, then counting back 14 days (or use your luteal phase length, if known) from the expected last day of your next cycle.<br>
<br>
Add:three or four days (or more, if you want extra cushion) on either side—especially prior to estimated ovulation day and that's your likely fertility window. The key days are the two or three days prior to ovulation but it's often best to hedge your bets by adding a few extra days.
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="tab-contents " id="Special considerations">
				<ul>
				If you are looking for approaches to identifying your fertile window that are more precise than ovulation calculator tools, consider trying the following:<br>
				<br>
				1. Charting your BBT<br>
				<br>
2. Paying very close attention to your body’s ovulation signs<br>
<br>
3. Tracking cervical mucus changes<br>
<br>
4. Using ovulation test kits (OPKs)<br>

				<p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which the ovaries produce an abnormal amount of androgens, male sex hormones that are usually present in women in small amounts.
				   The name polycystic ovary syndrome describes the numerous small cysts (fluid-filled sacs) that form in the ovaries.
				   However, some women with this disorder do not have cysts, while some women without the disorder do develop cysts.

				<div class="tab-contents " id="Pregnancy complications">
					<ul>
					Pregnancy is a complex process. While many women have normal pregnancies, complications can occur.
					However, having a complication does not mean you will not have a healthy baby. It means your provider will monitor you closely and take special care of you and your baby during the remainder of your term.<br>
					Common complications include:<br>
<br>
Diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes).<br>
High blood pressure during pregnancy (preeclampsia). Your provider will talk with you about how to care for yourself if you have preeclampsia.<br>
Premature or preterm changes in the cervix.<br>
Problems with the placenta. It may cover the cervix, pull away from the womb, or not work as well as it should.<br>
Vaginal bleeding.<br>
Early labor.<br>
Your baby is not growing well.<br>
Your baby has medical problems.<br>
<br>
It can be scary to think about possible problems. But it is important to be aware so you can tell your provider if you notice unusual symptoms.
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="tab-contents " id="Labor and delivery">
				<ul>
				Talk with your provider about what to expect during labor and delivery. You can make your wishes known by creating a birth plan. Talk with your provider about what to include in your birth plan. You may want to include things like:<br>
				<br>
How you want to manage pain during labor, including whether to have an epidural block<br>
How you feel about episiotomy<br>
What would happen if you need a C-section<br>
How you feel about forceps delivery or vacuum-assisted delivery<br>
Who you want with you during delivery<br>
<br>
As you get close to your due date, you will notice certain changes. It is not always easy to tell when you will go into labor. Your provider can tell you when it is time to come in for an exam or go to the hospital for delivery.

Talk with your provider about what happens if you pass your due date. Depending on your age and risk factors, your provider may need to induce labor around 39 to 42 weeks.

Once labor begins, you can use a number of strategies to get through labor.
